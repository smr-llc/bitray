Overview
---------

This is a prototype, work-in-progress library for gigantic, file-backed,
thread-safe, bit-resolution arrays. The goal of this library is to provide
useful abstractions and reasonable performance for tools that want to process
arbitrarily large blobs of data, like
`hobbits <https://github.com/Mahlet-Inc/hobbits>`_.

    cd bitray
    cmake . -Bbuild -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBITRAY_BUILD_TESTS=ON
    cmake --build build

Run a benchmark:
::

    ./build/tests/benchmarks/bm_byteray
