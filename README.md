# bitray

This is a prototype, work-in-progress library for gigantic, file-backed,
thread-safe, bit-resolution arrays. The goal of this library is to provide
useful abstractions and reasonable performance for tools that want to process
arbitrarily large blobs of data, like
[hobbits](https://github.com/Mahlet-Inc/hobbits).
